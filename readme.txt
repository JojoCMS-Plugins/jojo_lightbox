This is a Jojo port of the popular lightbox script found at http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/

To use, simply install the plugin and use rel="lightbox" on any hyperlink that surrounds an image.

eg.

<a href="images/500/foo.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/s100/foo.jpg" alt="" title="My Title" /></a>

or the equivalent in bbcode

[url=images/500/foo.jpg lightbox][img]images/500/foo.jpg[/img][/url]
